# Tensorflow

### Introduction
TensorFlow is one of the most in-demand and popular open-source deep learning frameworks available today. 
The DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate program taught to applied machine learning skills with TensorFlow so we can build and train powerful models. 

In this hands-on, four-course Professional Certificate program,I have learnt the necessary tools to build scalable AI-powered applications with TensorFlow. I have learnt new TensorFlow skills to a wide range of problems and projects.

### Overview
Best practices for TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework to train a neural network for a computer vision applications.

Handle real-world image data and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout.

Build natural language processing systems using TensorFlow.

Apply RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs as you train them using text repositories.

### Applied Learning Project:

In the DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate program, I Got hands-on experience through 16 Python programming assignments. By the end of this program, I'm ready to: 

- Build and train neural networks using TensorFlow

- Improve networkâ€™s performance using convolutions as we train it to identify real-world images

- Teach machines to understand, analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language processing systems

- Process text, represent sentences as vectors, and train a model to create original poetry!
